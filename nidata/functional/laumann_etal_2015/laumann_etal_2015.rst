Results from highly sampled individual human brain. The set includes data from .....

Tasks 
        task008: "Retinotopic mapping" 
        task009: "rest - eyes open"
        task002: "N-back task with faces, scenes, and Chinese characters"
        task003: "Dot-motion perception task with an embedded stop signal task"
        task001: "rest - eyes closed"
        task006: "Spatial working memory task with varied load"
        task007: "Breath holding task" 
        task004: "Multi-object localizer task" 
        task005: "Sentence/nonword working memory task" 

Content
-------
The dataset is broken into several parts:
    :Sessions 14-104 are from the original acquisition period of the study performed at the University of Texas using a Siemens Skyra 3T scanner.  All resting data were collected with eyes closed.
    :Session 105 is a follow-up session performed at Washington University using a Siemens Trio 3T scanner in which data were collected manipulating eyes open/closed across sessions.
    :Session 106 is a follow-up session performed at Stanford University using a GE MR750
    3T scanner, in which a high angular resolution diffusion imaging acquisition was performed.






            The full dataset additionally includes
                :'anat': Nifti images with anatomical image
                :'func': Nifti images with bold data
                :'mask_vt': Nifti images with mask for ventral visual/temporal cortex
                :'mask_face': Nifti images with face-reponsive brain regions
                :'mask_house': Nifti images with house-reponsive brain regions
                :'mask_face_little': Spatially more constrained version of the above
                :'mask_house_little': Spatially more constrained version of the above
